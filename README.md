###Project Structure

* PURPOSE - The Check Register Application has been created to assist in managing personal expenditures for individuals.  The application consists of the following four functions:

  1. (1) LIST CHECK - when this option is selected, a list of all check numbers, their dates, payees and amounts will be displayed on the screen sorted by the checks (in the order they were added).

  2. (2) ADD CHECK - when this option is selected, you are prompted with the ability to enter the following information about an individual check:
        - Check number (positive number greater than zero)
        - Check date (text string)
        - Payee (text string)
        - Check Amount (positive number)

  3. (3) MODIFY CHECK - when this option is selected, you can re-enter the information for a previously entered check (correcting data entry error or setting amount to zero for a voided check).  You must enter a valid check number already in the register.

  4. (4) DELETE CHECK - when this option is selected, you can delete a previously entered check number from the registry.  You must enter a valid check number already in the register.

  5. (0) EXIT - when this option is selected, the Check Register Application closes.
